# **Einops from Scratch**

This repository contains the code for the implementation of the `rearrange` function for tensors. It supports rearrangement and repetition transformations. The implementation is optimized using efficient parsing, utilizing only native Python functions and minimizing the number of array transformations.

import numpy as np

tensor = np.random.rand(2, 3, 4)
pattern = "b h w -> h w b"

result = rearrange(tensor, pattern)
print(result.shape)  # Expected output: (3, 4, 2)
```

## Brief Function Documentation
### `einops_rearrange.rearrange`

### **Parameters**

| Name          | Type                               | Description                                                                 | Default |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `tensor`     | `numpy.ndarray`    | A tensor from numpy library. | **Required** |
| `pattern`    | `str`                             | String specifying the desired rearrangement pattern.                     | **Required** |
| `axes_lengths` | `int`                          | Additional specifications for inferred dimensions.                       | `{}` |

### **Returns**

| Type   | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Tensor` | Tensor of the same type as the input|

**Note**  
- `(axis1 axis2 ..)` are used for composing axes.  
- `()` empty parentheses count as a unitary axis (not the same as an anonymous unit axis of size `1`).  
- `...` ellipsis can be used as a placeholder for multiple axes.

## **Implementation Approach**

Following is the description of the `rearrange` function, which supports `rearrange` and `repeat` functionality from `einops`. The package applies tensor transformations based on a pattern string, just like `einops`. The approach is broken into four distinct steps:

1. **Parser**
2. **Information Extractor**
3. **Dimension Calculator**
4. **Transformer**

### **Overview of the Process**

The overall workflow for the `rearrange` function is as follows:

1. **Input Validation:**  
   The main function performs input checks.

2. **Extract Transformation Details:**  
   The pattern string is processed through a parser that validates and breaks it into components.

3. **Compute Dimension Changes:**  
   The extracted information is used to determine the required reshaping, transposition, and repetition to achieve the target tensor layout.

4. **Apply Transformation:**  
   The tensor is transformed step-by-step:
   - **Initial Reshaping (if needed)**
   - **Transposition:** Reordering dimensions based on a computed permutation.
   - **Repetition:** Expanding axes where necessary.
   - **Final Reshaping:** Producing the final output tensor shape.

### **Detailed Steps**

#### **1. Parser**
- **Module:** `parser.py`  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Breaks down the provided pattern into a structured format.
  - Validates the presence and proper use of tokens like ellipsis (`...`), numeric dimensions (anonymous axes), and named axes.  

#### **2. Information Extractor**
- **Module:** `transform.py` (function: `extract_information`)  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Processes the parsed input and output patterns (obtained by splitting the pattern with `"->"`).  
  - Accounts for ellipsis by dynamically generating axis names if needed.  
  - Establishes mappings for axis-to-position and their respective lengths.  
  - Determines known and unknown dimensions, as well as the permutation order for transposition.  

#### **3. Dimension Calculator**
- **Module:** `transform.py` (function: `infer_shape`)  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Computes the necessary reshaping parameters before and after the main transformation.  
  - Infers unknown axis sizes by comparing known products of dimensions with the actual tensor shape.  
  - Determines whether an initial or final reshape is required based on the pattern structure.  

#### **4. Transformer**
- **Module:** `transform.py` (function: `apply_transform`)  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Applies the computed transformations to the tensor using numpy `reshape`, `transpose`, `broadcast`, and `expand_dims`, based on the data provided by previous functions.  
  - **Initial Reshape:** If the inferred shape indicates, the tensor is reshaped to an intermediate form.  
  - **Transposition:** The tensorâ€™s dimensions are reordered based on the permutation order extracted earlier.  
  - **Repetition:** New axes are inserted and then broadcast to the appropriate size.  
  - **Final Reshape:** If required, the tensor is reshaped into its final target dimensions.
